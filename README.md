LocationDetailsGet: Gets the Fishing Location Details upon user request. Will be used on the search page
AddNews: Adds News to the FishingNews table for users to submit (500 error)

Chat GPT did all of the commenting
Chat GPT also fixed an error I had where Visual Basic said that primary keys were not defined (provided code from the data table and asked chat gpt to rewrite
it to define primary keys)

**Was getting 500 errors on both APIs on shared Repo, so I made my own. Fixed the issue for LocationDetailsGet.
