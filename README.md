LocationDetailsGet: Gets the Fishing Location Details upon user request. Will be used on the search page. Currently ID is input and everything associated with that ID is the output.
AddNews: Adds News to the FishingNews table for users to submit. New item with an ID and NewsDetails is the input, output is a new item created in the database (500 error).

Chat GPT did all of the commenting
Chat GPT also fixed an error I had where Visual Basic said that primary keys were not defined (provided code from the data table and asked chat gpt to rewrite
it to define primary keys)

word doc with the web application user experience and features is linked in the repo as "Homework 4"

**Was getting 500 errors on both APIs on shared Repo, so I made my own. Fixed the issue for LocationDetailsGet.
